# CiviCRM Inky Compose

CiviCRM Inky Compose is a CiviCRM extension that allows you to compose emails using the Inky email templating language and a few other clever tools. It is built upon the following principles:

* Make the input as concise as possible
* Make the output as beautiful as possible

This way of composing emails is not for everyone. You might love it but you might hate it.  If you hate it, then you might have a better time with [Mosaico](https://civicrm.org/extensions/email-template-builder).

Full documentation may already be available at https://docs.civicrm.org/inky-compose. Until it is, see the [docs](docs) directory in this repo.
